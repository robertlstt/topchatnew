## TOPCHAT
A simple design to cut out chat noise for streamers, meant to be used instead of, or in addition to, their normal chat window.

Allows streamer to filter chat based on a few key support metrics that bring value to streamer

Allows viewer to feel rewarded and special for their contributions

Builds a "topchat" club threshold that can be set by streamer to incentivise viewers into reach the threshold and becoming a top chatter, with higher visibility of their messages and more interaction with streamer

Next steps:
Build Topchat into a standalone steamlabs app

Leverage streamlabs api and data to further let streamers and viewers get more value

Build out backend and AI to pick out viewers who could have high lifetime value for the streamer and have not yet interacted monetarily with the stream
IE: talk to this person, they support streamers they like

Build in more extended AI functionality and data usage    
IE: do a partner stream with this viewer, you have a lot of overlapping viewership and can both grow your audience
